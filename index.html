        My work explores interactions with physiological signals in daily life. I develop alternative representations of these signals and study experiences and interpretations around these artifacts, leveraging material properties to create new associations and interpretations. Through broadening the design space around biosensing, I probe what relationships with physiological data might mean for our social relationships and sense of self.

This sculpture is inspired by the Arabic word "salaam." Salaam means "peace" and is also used as a greeting to wish peace upon others. This project was motivated by an upsurge in mosque arsons in early 2017, with a focus on one story in particular. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Victoria-Islamic-Center-100232630071179/">Victoria Islamic Center</a> in Texas was burned down in January. To raise money to rebuild, a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/victoria-islamic-center-rebuilding">GoFundMe campaign</a> was created, and the campaign was extremely successful, doubling its initial goal. Comments posted to the website of the GoFundMe campaign are shown on the sculpture. It is tragic that this arson occurred, but the success of the GoFundMe campaign also points to community resilience and support. The sculpture was shown at the <a href="http://aaads.berkeley.edu/2017/02/8th-annual-islamophobia-conference/">8th Annual Islamophobia Conference</a> and in public locations on Berkeley's campus for a few days in April 2017.
</p>

<p>
Passerby were invited to add their own writing or drawing to the sculpture using markers or spray chalk, and perhaps pause to reflect on issues around diversity, acceptance, acts of violence, and the maintenance of peace. Over a few days, passerby's additions made the sculpture come to life.
</p>

<p>
This project was motivated by personal and family experiences with Islamophobia and a desire to spread peace and friendship in response.

This short participatory performance imagined a VR centered around local embodied presence. First, participants each made their own VR headset out of paper and decorated it to their liking. Then, while screen captured video of VR experiences played on screen, I guided the audience as we all physically re-enacted these VR experiences, reaching and pulling and turning and racing together. Wearing masks and physically performing VR helped us collectively reimagine what VR could be.

<p>
This paper explores the social meaning of clothing-based displays of biosignals. How do friends make sense of their own and each other's skin conductance display in the context of a conversation? We developed Hint, a dynamic thermochromic t-shirt with ambiguous patterns that change color when its wearer's skin conductance increases, an indication of sudden arousal. We investigated how pairs of friends, each wearing the shirt, conversed and interpreted the display. Participants shared a broad range of interpretations, and emotions such as joy and embarrassment were associated with an increase in skin conductance. Additionally, participants expressed desires for their skin conductance displays to help validate their feelings and show emotional engagement with others. We explore ambiguity in the context of clothing-based information displays and discuss how skin conductance display became part of social performance in our study. From there, we suggest framing biosignals as social cues along with facial expression, gestures, etc., and begin to question what design territories this might uncover.

</div>

<p>This paper explores the role dynamic textile displays play in relation to personal style: What does it mean to wear computationally responsive clothing and why would one be motivated to do so? We developed a novel textile display technology, called Ebb, and created several woven and crochet fabric swatches that explored clothing-specific design possibilities. We engaged fashion designers and non-designers in imagining how Ebb would integrate into their design practice or personal style of dressing. Participants evaluated the appeal and utility of clothing-based displays according to a very different set of criteria than traditional screen-based computational displays. Specifically, the slowness, low-resolution, and volatility of Ebb tended to be seen as assets as opposed to technical limitations in the context of personal style. Additionally, participants envisioned various ways that ambiguous, ambient, and abstract displays of information could prompt new experiences in their everyday lives. Our paper details the complex relationships between display and personal style and offers a new design metaphor and extension of Gaver et al.'s original descriptions of ambiguity in order to guide the design of clothing-based displays for everyday life.</p>

We mentored students making independent web apps every Friday afternoon. High school and middle school students come with any level of experience, and we helped them find a project they are interested in, set goals, design the UI, and write code. Past projects have included an anime-inspired video game and a guide to getting into college.

<p>We made a wearable companion designed to calm and comfort kids. When Buddy senses that the child is getting upset, it curls up and makes unhappy noises. This helps the child become more self-aware of their own mood, and redirects the child's attention toward comforting Buddy. By petting Buddy along his back, the child can calm themself down and make Buddy feel better too. Then he uncurls and makes happy noises.</p>

<p>We made an audio effects controller for DJs using the <a href="http://www.thalmic.com/">Myo</a> armband. Moving their arm instead of twisting a knob helps DJs multitask, be more performative, and have fun without sacrificing precise control--aspects of the experience which were important to our users. Through several iterations, we tested using Leap Motion or Myo for the best possible user experience.</p>

<p>Using C++, the application converts Myo input to MIDI output. The MIDI output goes to the GUI, written in Processing, and to whatever audio software the DJ prefers, such as Serato or Traktor.</p>

<p>The Intel Labs project ConnectAnyThing (<a href="https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing">release repo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Noura/cat">development repo</a>) makes it possible to use Intel's Galileo microcontroller without writing a line of code. It enables creative play and rapid prototyping. I worked on the UI design as well as client and server side code, for real-time responsiveness and consistent state across the microcontroller, multiple clients interacting simultaneously, and the server.</p>

<p>MakerNode (<a href="https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/MakerNode">repo</a>), a work in progress, is intended to provide a simple workflow for node.js projects on Galileo.</p>

An interactive Lissajous curves visualizer for exploration, pretty patterns, and random music generation. Lissajous curves represent stereo sound by plotting the left and right speaker positions on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively.

Another interactive curve visualizer, this time inspired by Meara O'Reilly's <a href="http://mearaoreilly.com/index.php?/project/for-bjoerks-biophilia/">collaboration</a> with Bj&ouml;rk for the latter's Biophilia Tour. Chladni curves show how waves propagate across a flat, finite surface. Each point's acceleration is inversely proportional to the relative position of its neighbors, so higher points get pulled down and vice versa. Waves reflect against the edges of the surface, and the constructive and destructive interference creates beautiful patterns. I made this with <a href="http://tytel.org/">Matt Tytel</a>.

<p>Traditional Balinese architecture often uses bamboo blinds instead of exterior walls to maximize air circulation for cooling. During nice weather, they are raised, and during hot or rainy weather, they are lowered. If it starts raining while no one is home, then all the furniture will get soaked and probably start to mildew.</p>

<p>I prototyped a system whereby the bamboo blinds lower automatically when it starts to rain. A moisture sensor sends an electrical signal to the Galileo board, which triggers the motor.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.alamsantidesign.com/">Alam Santi</a>, which blends traditional and modern technologies to create sustainable homes, and Intel Labs, which provided the ConnectAnyThing interface and Galileo used for this interconnected home system.</p>

      <h1>Mobile Phones & Illiteracy in Morocco</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 content">

      <p>
    Many illiterate Moroccans use a mobile phone personally and professionally. They rely on friends or strangers to help them make calls and navigate the text based Arabic or French interface. Our goal was to help these people use the phones they already own independently. As project manager on a team of <a href="http://www.olin.edu/">Olin</a> design and engineering students, <a href="http://www.babson.edu/">Babson</a> business students, and Moroccan <a href="http://www.enim.ac.ma/">&Eacute;cole Nationale de L'Industrie Min&eacute;rale</a> engineering students, I led the design process through user research, problem definition, prototype iteration, and pilot testing.
</p>

<img src="/static/img/largest/apples.jpg">

<p>
    We interviewed numerous illiterate working Moroccan adults to understand how mobile phones fit into their lifestyles, including bicycle mechanics, produce vendors, bakers, maids, taxi cab drivers, and construction workers. Most own at least one mobile phone which they use for work and calling family and friends. Third hand Nokia bar phones are most common. Contacts are recorded on paper notebooks or scraps of cardboard. 
</p>

<p>
    They struggle to unlock their phone, find the contact's number, dial the number, add contacts, and add minutes. We focused on finding and dialing contacts because these needs are most time sensitive. We prototyped and pilot tested a transitional solution which accommodated current usage patterns and price constraints while augmenting the memory and learning abilities of illiterate users.

      <h1>Biosignals Experiments</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 content">

      <p>I am interested in exploring a myriad of possibilities for biosignals sharing. Heart beats, breathing, galvanic skin response, EEG, and other signals are becoming easier to collect and share. Applications in fitness, self-tracking, meditation, and closeness at a distance are emerging. By making a series of one-off prototypes, whether they are desirable, undesirable, or simply weird, I hope to broaden the design space for biosignal sharing.</p>

<h2>listening to a song and feeling sad</h2>

<a href="/experiments/sad-song/">
  <img src="/static/img/largest/peacebone_gsr.png">
  <div class="caption">(turn your volume down before proceeding)</div>
</a>

<p>Biosignals sharing is being used for emotional closeness and connection, such as with <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/new-ways-to-connect/">Apple Watch's heart beat sharing</a>. Rather than seeking emotional closeness to build or maintain a relationship, in this experiment I try out using biosignal sharing as a way of expressing emotional distance after a breakup. In contrast to prevalent notions around sharing that favor easily understood expressions of happiness and connectivity, this piece shares a somewhat obscure expression of sadness and separation in the form of a distorted audio signal.</p>

<p>Galvanic skin response (GSR) recorded while listening to a personally significant song offers evidence of my emotional response. In lieu of an audio visualization, the time-synced GSR values are plotted on the left and used to distort the audio. Sometimes the GSR measurements rise and fall with the rising and falling tension or energy in the music, but most of the signal is idiosyncratic, creating a playback of the song that uniquely represents my emotion while listening.</p>

<p>Can biosignals augment our communication? Can they offer "proof" of feeling? How can they be used for self-expression?</p>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 content">

      
<p>As a software engineer at <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>, I worked on a variety of data-driven web applications, including a tool for creating generative radio station playlists and internal tools for verifying music data.</p>

<p>
    SiriusXM's <a href="http://blog.echonest.com/post/48040487056/mysxm">MySXM personalized radio stations</a> are created by SiriusXM's music programmers using this tool, made by The Echo Nest. I worked with one other web developer on the front end JavaScript application. Highlights included throttling AJAX requests to reliably load thousands of dynamically structured song objects, maintaining a responsive interface while loading, sorting, and filtering those objects, and automatically suggesting possible areas of concern to the music programmers to guide their design of these radio stations.
</p>

<p>
    Data accuracy is of utmost importance to The Echo Nest because data is its primary product, and the continually growing database regularly rolls out to enterprise customers. The tools enabled anyone to view and edit dynamically structured data objects and helped create tasks, workflow, and performance tracking for quality assurance interns.
