          This sculpture is inspired by the Arabic word "salaam." Salaam means "peace" and is also used as a greeting to wish peace upon others. This project was motivated by recent events. A mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned down in January. To raise money to rebuild, a GoFundMe campaign was created, and the campaign was extremely successful, doubling its initial goal. Comments posted to the website of the GoFundMe campaign will be shown on the sculpture.

          The sculpture invites passerby to pause and reflect on issues around diversity, acceptance, acts of violence, and the maintenance of peace in this country. It is tragic that this arson occurred, but the success of the GoFundMe campaign also points to community resilience and support.

          The sculpture is made of fabric and inflated. As such, it is lightweight, easy to set up and take down, and poses no structural risks.

          <p>
          Next steps are to make the sculpture curve around to create a sense of space that people can enter.
