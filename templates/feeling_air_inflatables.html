<i>Feeling Air: A Psychospeculative Inflatable Happening</i> explores material, aesthetic, and somatic qualities of large scale architectural inflatables. The inflatables were designed and built by architecture assistant professor <a href="https://design.ncsu.edu/people/ssprotz/">Shawn Protz</a> and the students of his fall 2021 project studio: Jasmyn Byrd, Miguel Castellanos, Alexis Elkins, Jessica Hall, Micah Holdsworth, Lalith Mallikeshwaran Rajagopal Sambasivan, Chris Noel, Oluwarotimi
Osiberu, Rushabh Patel, Dylan Scallan, and Abigail Uhrich. I collaborated with them in fall 2021 by hosting a joint <a href"http://localhost:8000/teaching/emotion_ml_project_studio.html">project studio</a> in which my students developed an interactive experience with Emotion ML which took place inside the inflatable. My students took a critical making approach, inviting critical reflection on the growing prevalence of Emotion ML and its use for surveillance. Through our collaboration we explored translucence and surveillance in public space.
