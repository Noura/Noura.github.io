<p>The Intel Labs project ConnectAnyThing (<a href="https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing">release repo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Noura/cat">development repo</a>) makes it possible to use Intel's Galileo microcontroller without writing a line of code. It enables creative play and rapid prototyping. I worked on the UI design as well as client and server side code, for real-time responsiveness and consistent state across the microcontroller, multiple clients interacting simultaneously, and the server.</p>

<p>MakerNode (<a href="https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/MakerNode">repo</a>), a work in progress, is intended to provide a simple workflow for node.js projects on Galileo.</p>
