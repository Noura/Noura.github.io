      <h1>Teaching</h1>

      <p>
      I teach all levels of user research, human centered design, tangible design, embodied design, and interaction design; physical computing with microcontrollers and circuits; and introductory computer science. With a project-centered approach, I challenge students to consider the social, aesthetic, technical, and political implications of their work. <a href="/static/pdf/Howell_Teaching_Statement.pdf">Teaching Statement (pdf)</a>

      What&rsquo;s wrong with the internet, and what are you going to do about it? In this undergraduate class for communication majors, we engaged this question through readings and critical making. Topics included algorithmic oppression, biometric surveillance, content moderation, and emotional biosensing. Readings included Safiya Umoja Noble, Joy Buolamwini, Simone Browne, and Sarah Roberts.

      <p>
      Teaching assistant, fall 2016 &amp; 2017 &amp; 2018, with professor Kimiko Ryokai at University of California, Berkeley
      </p>

      <p>
      This class teaches theory and practice of tangible interaction design. My duties included providing critique and mentorship on student projects and hands-on Arduino, electronics, and soldering instruction. I also helped revamp the curriculum to include more interaction design theories such as reflective, speculative, and critical design; more hands-on design thinking activities; and more circuit explorations that produce sound.
