      <h1>Teaching</h1>

      <p>
      I teach all levels of user research, human centered design, tangible design, embodied design, and interaction design; physical computing with microcontrollers and circuits; and introductory computer science. With a project-centered approach, I challenge students to consider the social, aesthetic, technical, and political implications of their work. <a href="/static/pdf/Howell_Teaching_Statement.pdf">Teaching Statement (pdf)</a>

      <h2 class="line-divider">Biosensing Technologies in Everyday Life</h2>

      <p>
      In this graduate seminar, we read and discussed readings about social implications of biosensing technologies in everyday life. Topics included a survey of the latest technical biosensing capabilities, affective computing, smart home and smart city applications, self-tracking, somaesthetic design, predictive policing, biometric surveillance, and artistic provocations.

      <h2 class="line-divider">Critical Design Futuring</h2>

      <p>
      In this class, students critically analyze social impacts of digital technology, and creatively imagine alternatives. By learning about sociotechnical imaginaries, students start to unpack prevalent narratives around society and technology, learn that these narratives are not inevitable, and imagine alternative narratives. Topics included sociotechnical imaginaries, algorithms of oppression, filter bubbles, fake news, biometric surveillance, and
      emotional biosensing. We tried out the <a href="/projects/design_futuring.html">alternative approaches to design futuring</a>. Readings included Ruha Benjamin, Safiya Umoja Noble, Joy Buolamwini, Sheila Jasanoff, Sang-Hyun Kim, and Paul Dourish.

      <p>
      What&rsquo;s wrong with the internet, and what are you going to do about it? In this undergraduate class for communication majors, we engaged this question through readings and critical making. Topics included algorithmic oppression, biometric surveillance, content moderation, and emotional biosensing. Readings included Safiya Umoja Noble, Joy Buolamwini, Simone Browne, and Sarah Roberts.

      <h2 class="line-divider">Tangible User Interfaces</h2>

      <p>
      How can tangible, embodied interactions provide richer, more meaningful interactions with digital media? This graduate class teaches theory and practice of tangible interaction design. My duties included providing critique and mentorship on student projects and hands-on Arduino, electronics, and soldering instruction. I also helped revamp the curriculum to include more interaction design theories such as reflective, speculative, and critical design; more hands-on design thinking activities; and more circuit explorations that produce sound.
