    As a tangible interaction designer I explore relationships with emotional biosensory data. How might interactions with data influence our sense of self, social relationships, and practices of care? What might it be like to experience data without quantification? How can emotional biosensing support alternative ways of feeling and living?
    I'm fortunate to study as a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/noura-howell">Berkeley School of Information</a> advised by <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kimiko/">Kimiko Ryokai</a> and as a member of the <a href="http://biosense.berkeley.edu/">BioSENSE</a> lab. Previously I have worked as a human centered designer and engineer in Singapore, Morocco, and China, as well as at the MIT Media Lab, Intel Labs, and Microsoft.
