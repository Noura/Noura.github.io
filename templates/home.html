    I wend pathways of <b>data and difference</b> focused on <b>emotional biosensing</b>. Sensors on our bodies and in public space produce data pertaining to our emotions. These emergent ways of knowing the emotional self and others via data bolster seemingly authoritative data-driven yet embodied categories like un/well or un/productive. These categories are anything but neutral: Some are 'normal' and some are 'other'. This has the potential to create new forms of otherization or reify existing forms of otherization such as Islamophobia, eugenics, or racialization. Intervening in ths process, I

    <b>Reconfigure</b> sensing, data, and data representation as a series of material transformations, opening up spaces to critique data's seeming authority and embrace embodied ways of knowing and feeling
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Design</b> alternative experiences with data that respect difference and avoid otherizing categorization
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Offer new concepts</b> for design such as <i>life-affirmation</i>

    My approach combines new materialist lenses that foreground the agency of materials, critical and speculative design research, tangible interaction design, and hands-on engineering to create fully functional biosensing technologies. These artifacts provoke critical discussion around emotional biosensing. Additionally, the rich experiences of people with and around these artifacts probe alternative possibilities with biosensory data, situated in the real emotional stakes of everyday lives.

    I'm fortunate to study as a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/noura-howell">Berkeley School of Information</a> advised by <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kimiko/">Kimiko Ryokai</a> and as a member of the <a href="http://biosense.berkeley.edu/">BioSENSE</a> lab. Previously I have worked as a human centered designer and engineer in Singapore, Morocco, and China, as well as at the MIT Media Lab, Intel Labs, and Microsoft.
