      How do we make meaning with data? Not only analytically, but also with our feelings, bodies, materials, and social relationships?
      </p>
      <p>My design research investigates ways of knowing with biosensory data - data about people&rsquo;s bodies and behaviors. Combining critical making, speculative design, and participatory experiences, I challenge dominant techno-logics of data and explore alternatives. I work with code, circuits, wood, e-textiles, and sound.

      Starting in fall 2020, I will be an assistant professor at North Carolina State University's Department of Communication. I am currently filing my dissertation at University of California, Berkeley, at the School of Information.
