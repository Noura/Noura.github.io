      <p>My design research investigates emotion AI &mdash; algorithmic ways of knowing emotion that use biosensory data about people&rsquo;s bodies and behaviors. Combining custom sensor technologies, machine learning, and design research, I challenge dominant techno-logics of data and explore alternatives. I work with code, circuits, wood, e-textiles, and sound.
