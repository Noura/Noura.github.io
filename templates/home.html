      How can sensors and data invite more ethical, respectful ways of knowing ourselves and others? How can sensor technologies allow space for human differences, uncertainty, and the irreducible complexity of human experiences?
      </p>
      <p>My design research investigates ways of knowing with biosensory data - data about people&rsquo;s bodies, behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Combining critical making, speculative design, and participatory experiences, I challenge dominant techno-logics of data and explore alternatives. I work with code, circuits, wood, e-textiles, and sound.
