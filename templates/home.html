      I combine critical and speculative design research, tangible embodied interaction design, and hands-on engineering to create biosensing technologies. These artifacts provoke critical discussion around the role of sensing technologies in our everyday lives. Additionally, the rich experiences of people around these artifacts probe alternative possibilities.
