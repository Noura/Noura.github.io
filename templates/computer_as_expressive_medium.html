    One fall 2024 student group imagined a future world in which people can buy and sell memories. They created commodified memories of an art gallery, in which the artist's pieces receive initially positive and then increasingly harsh audience reception. The viewer can explore the 3D space of the art gallery, until they find a back door that opens into a closet revealing the inner thoughts of the artist and the hidden layers of meaning and personal struggle of
    the artworks.
