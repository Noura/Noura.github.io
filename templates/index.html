          <p>As a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, I explore the convergence of biosensing and textile technologies for affective and creative interactions. Previously I worked on creative applications at Intel Labs and the MIT Media Lab, music-related front end software development for The Echo Nest, and sustainable development projects in Bali, Morocco, and China. I received my bachelor's degree in Engineering with a Concentration in Computing from Olin College of Engineering. Prior to engineering and design I dabbled in graph theory and environmental chemistry research.</p>
