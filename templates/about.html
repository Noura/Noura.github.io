<p>As PhD student at the <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a> at UC Berkeley, I do design research at the convergence of biosensing and textile technologies for affective and creative interactions. Previously I worked on creative applications at Intel Labs and the MIT Media Lab, music-related front end software development for The Echo Nest, and sustainable development projects in Bali, Morocco, and China. I received my bachelor's degree in Engineering with a Concentration in Computing from Olin College of Engineering. Prior to engineering and design I dabbled in graph theory and biochemistry research.</p>
