      My design research explores tangible, embodied, social, and emotional ways of making meaning with <i>biosensory data</i>, data about people&rsquo;s bodies, thoughts, and behaviors. What can (and can&rsquo;t) this data say about how we feel? How might this data shape the way we feel, and shape how we relate to ourselves and others? I explore these questions by building sensing technologies that produce data, such as heart rate or skin conductance, and display it an unusual way, such as color-changing fabric or sound. I set up situations where people interact with these sensor-and-data-display technologies in an open-ended way, often with mundane but real social consequences, such as pairs of friends talking about their feelings. The highly varied and often surprising social and emotional experiences of people with these designs offer provocative yet experientially grounded speculative directions for designing with data.
