This short participatory performance imagined a VR centered around local embodied presence. First, participants each made their own VR headset out of paper and decorated it to their liking. Then, while screen captured video of VR experiences played on screen, I guided the audience as we all physically re-enacted these VR experiences, reaching and pulling and turning and racing together. Wearing masks and physically performing VR helped us collectively reimagine what VR could be.
