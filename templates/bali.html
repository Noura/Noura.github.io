<p>Traditional Balinese architecture often uses bamboo blinds instead of exterior walls to maximize air circulation for cooling. During nice weather, they are raised, and during hot or rainy weather, they are lowered. If it starts raining while no one is home, then all the furniture will get soaked and probably start to mildew.</p>

<p>I prototyped a system whereby the bamboo blinds lower automatically when it starts to rain. A moisture sensor sends an eletrical signal to the Galileo board, which triggers the motor.</p>

<p>I worked with <a href="http://www.alamsantidesign.com/">Alam Santi</a>, which blends traditional and modern technologies to create sustainable homes, and Intel Labs, which provided the ConnectAnyThing interface and Galileo used for this interconnected home system.</p>
