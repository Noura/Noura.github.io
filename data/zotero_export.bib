	abstract = {The problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters in a radio network can be modeled through vertex labelings of a graph, wherein each vertex represents a transmitter and edges connect vertices whose corresponding transmitters are operating in close proximity. In one such model, an L ( 2 , 1 ) -labeling of a graph G is employed, which is an assignment fof nonnegative integers to the vertices of G such that if vertices x and y are adjacent, {\textbar} f ( x ) − f ( y ) {\textbar} ≥ 2 , and if x and y are at distance two, {\textbar} f ( x ) − f ( y ) {\textbar} ≥ 1 . The λ -number of G is the minimum span over all L ( 2 , 1 ) -labelings of G. Informally, an amalgamation of two graphs G 1 and G 2 along a fixed graph G 0 is the simple graph obtained by identifying the vertices of two induced subgraphs isomorphic to G 0 , one of G 1 and the other of G 2 . We provide upper bounds for the λ -number of the amalgamation of graphs along a given graph by determining the exact λ -number of amalgamations of complete graphs along a complete graph. We also provide the exact λ -numbers of amalgamations of rectangular grids along a path, or more specifically, of the Cartesian products of a path and a star with spokes of arbitrary lengths.},

How do friends make sense of their own and each other's skin conductance display in the context of a conversation? We developed Hint, a dynamic thermochromic t-shirt whose ambiguous pattern changes color when its wearer's skin conductance increases, an indication of sudden arousal. We investigated how pairs of friends each wearing the shirt conversed and interpreted the display. Participants shared a broad range of interpretations; e.g., joy and embarrassment were associated with an increase in skin conductance. Additionally, participants expressed desires for their skin conductance display to help validate their feelings and show emotional engagement with others. We explore ambiguity in the context of clothing-based information displays and discuss how skin conductance display became part of social performance in our study. From there, we suggest framing biosignals as social cues along with facial expression, gestures, etc., and begin to question what design territories this might uncover.},

We developed a novel textile display technology, called Ebb, and created several woven and crochet fabric swatches that explored clothing-specific design possibilities. We engaged fashion designers and non-designers in imagining how Ebb would integrate into their design practice or personal style of dressing. Participants evaluated the appeal and utility of clothing-based displays according to a very different set of criteria than traditional screen-based computational displays. Specifically, the slowness, low-resolution, and volatility of Ebb tended to be seen as assets as opposed to technical limitations in the context of personal style. Additionally, participants envisioned various ways that ambiguous, ambient, and abstract displays of information could prompt new experiences in their everyday lives. Our paper details the complex relationships between display and personal style and offers a new design metaphor and extension of Gaver et al.'s original descriptions of ambiguity in order to guide the design of clothing-based displays for everyday life.},

Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience.},

Rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. So, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: Ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore Ripple over 2 days of daily life. While some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' Ripple provided between body and emotion, for others Ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. Despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. Using biopolitics to speculate on Ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.},

We intend to cohere the projects of the workshop participants into a set of artifacts, images, and theory to create an annotated portfolio that represents the state-of-the art in designing with biodata in HCI. The workshop will be structured around four themes relating to the use and contexts of working with biodata: 1. Making sense of biodata by taking into account a holistic perspective of body, mind and emotions, as exemplified through soma design methods in HCI, for example; 2. Feminist perspectives of biodata that take into account bodily transitions, pluralities of bodies and temporalities of bodies; 3. Non-anthropocentric perspectives of working with and making sense of biodata, to also account for microorganisms and other material agencies in our bodies; and 4. Emerging domains, contexts, and practices around the use of biodata, such as health, affective, and performance contexts. The significance of the workshop is twofold: One, we will produce a group of researchers and practitioners that are working with biodata, aiming to unpack, discuss and respond to critical issues around designing with and for it. Two, we will create an annotated portfolio that can travel on its own as documentation and vision for future biodata-based design practices.},

CDF allows us to consider, imagine, explore, and speculate on futures that are probable, possible, and even provocative and empowering. In this two-day workshop, we employ CDF to explore and imagine the future of human relationships - friendships, love, and romance - amidst a pandemic that has socially ravaged the entire world. Our changing relationship with each other and with technology is a hotbed of innovation, and an opportunity for us to reconsider and redefine human bonding and intimacy. The first day consists of expert presentations and discussions, where participants are introduced to CDF, designing for the future, and novel perspectives for thinking about the future. Participants work in small teams of 4-6, with one workshop organizer moderating each team, and collaboratively consider future, or past/present, scenarios, services, or products that assists in creating and/or nurturing human (or non-human) relationships. Participants have 24 hours to create a print, audio, or video advert for their product or service. On the second day, teams continue to work together to finalize their advert, which they then present and discuss in the larger group. Overall, the workshop aims to ignite innovative, and even provocative, ideas and alternative scenarios, building on this year’s conference theme of “Sense, Feel, Design”.},

Responding to this, we argue that a plurality of perspectives is needed to engage imaginations that depict a diverse unfolding of potential futures. Through reflecting on our own cultural and professional backgrounds, we offer five perspectives for design futuring as a contribution to this plurality: Parallel Presents, “I Am Time”, Epithelial Metaphors, the Uncertainties Cone, and Meet (with) “Speculation”. These perspectives open alternative approaches to design futuring, move outside prevalent notions of technological progress, and foreground interdependent, relational agencies.},

	abstract = {The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation has become a topic of conversation across HCI, CSCW, and other computing communities. This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring” through co-designed speculative design fictions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fictions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},
