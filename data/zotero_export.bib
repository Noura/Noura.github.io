  abstract = {This paper suggests how reflective design can aid informal participatory algorithm auditing. Drawing from reflective design, we designed a simple web-form probe to invite critical reflection on Emotion AI, ethically controversial techniques predicting individuals' emotions. Participants engaged the probe throughout their daily lives for about a week. Then, we interviewed participants about their experiences and reflections. Our findings surface themes around participants' (i) critiques of Emotion AI, (ii) factors contributing to inaccuracy, and (iii) patterns of miscategorization. Our discussion contributes (1) recommendations for Emotion AI and (2) how reflective design may offer considerations to inform algorithm auditing. Overall, our paper suggests ways critically-oriented design research can engage AI ethics through informal, participatory, exploratory algorithm auditing.},

Specifically, we deconstruct three "polished" exhibits of our installation through stories of breakdowns and failures, organized in three main themes: maintenance and care, buggy biodata, and collective resistance to purification and control. Our reflections show how plants, technologies, and a chronically ill body became entangled with each other conceptually and materially, surfacing new sites for more-than-human relationalities. In our discussion, we unpack how disability perspectives can expand more-than-human design practices, highlight opportunities for re-imagining exhibition spaces, and offer adaptation as a strategy for design in HCI.},

  abstract = {The problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters in a radio network can be modeled through vertex labelings of a graph, wherein each vertex represents a transmitter and edges connect vertices whose corresponding transmitters are operating in close proximity. In one such model, an L ( 2 , 1 ) -labeling of a graph G is employed, which is an assignment fof nonnegative integers to the vertices of G such that if vertices x and y are adjacent, {\textbar} f ( x ) - f ( y ) {\textbar} {$\geq$} 2 , and if x and y are at distance two, {\textbar} f ( x ) - f ( y ) {\textbar} {$\geq$} 1 . The {$\lambda$} -number of G is the minimum span over all L ( 2 , 1 ) -labelings of G. Informally, an amalgamation of two graphs G 1 and G 2 along a fixed graph G 0 is the simple graph obtained by identifying the vertices of two induced subgraphs isomorphic to G 0 , one of G 1 and the other of G 2 . We provide upper bounds for the {$\lambda$} -number of the amalgamation of graphs along a given graph by determining the exact {$\lambda$} -number of amalgamations of complete graphs along a complete graph. We also provide the exact {$\lambda$} -numbers of amalgamations of rectangular grids along a path, or more specifically, of the Cartesian products of a path and a star with spokes of arbitrary lengths.},

Its broad uptake suggests it has empowered people to learn, teach, and explore ML concepts: People have created curriculum, tutorials, and other resources using Teachable Machine on topics like AI ethics at institutions including the Stanford d.school, NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, the MIT Media Lab, as well as creative experiments. Users in 201 countries have created over 125,000 classification models. Here we outline the project and its key contributions of (1) a flexible, approachable interface for ML classification models without ML or coding expertise, (2) a set of technical and design decisions that can inform future interactive machine learning tools, and (3) an example of how structured learning content surrounding the tool supports people accessing ML concepts.},

We developed a novel textile display technology, called Ebb, and created several woven and crochet fabric swatches that explored clothing-specific design possibilities. We engaged fashion designers and non-designers in imagining how Ebb would integrate into their design practice or personal style of dressing. Participants evaluated the appeal and utility of clothing-based displays according to a very different set of criteria than traditional screen-based computational displays. Specifically, the slowness, low-resolution, and volatility of Ebb tended to be seen as assets as opposed to technical limitations in the context of personal style. Additionally, participants envisioned various ways that ambiguous, ambient, and abstract displays of information could prompt new experiences in their everyday lives. Our paper details the complex relationships between display and personal style and offers a new design metaphor and extension of Gaver et al.'s original descriptions of ambiguity in order to guide the design of clothing-based displays for everyday life.},

We developed Hint, a dynamic thermochromic t-shirt whose ambiguous pattern changes color when its wearer's skin conductance increases, an indication of sudden arousal. We investigated how pairs of friends each wearing the shirt conversed and interpreted the display. Participants shared a broad range of interpretations; e.g., joy and embarrassment were associated with an increase in skin conductance. Additionally, participants expressed desires for their skin conductance display to help validate their feelings and show emotional engagement with others. We explore ambiguity in the context of clothing-based information displays and discuss how skin conductance display became part of social performance in our study. From there, we suggest framing biosignals as social cues along with facial expression, gestures, etc., and begin to question what design territories this might uncover.},

Responding to this, we argue that a plurality of perspectives is needed to engage imaginations that depict a diverse unfolding of potential futures. Through reflecting on our own cultural and professional backgrounds, we offer five perspectives for design futuring as a contribution to this plurality: Parallel Presents, ``I Am Time'', Epithelial Metaphors, the Uncertainties Cone, and Meet (with) ``Speculation''. These perspectives open alternative approaches to design futuring, move outside prevalent notions of technological progress, and foreground interdependent, relational agencies.},

Our discussion contributes to broader reflections on shifting design research practice: (a) methodological considerations inviting others to engage failures through retrospective trioethnography, (b) letting go as a mode of research care, (c) possibilities for more candid research reporting, and (d) how centering failure may contribute to design justice by providing a technique for attending to harm and healing in design research practices. Throughout, we call for challenging success narratives in design research, and underscore the need for systemic changes in design research practice.},

  abstract = {Emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: Data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while CSCW explores new biosensing possibilities. Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience.},

We outline our design intent to invite rest, reflection, and recognition of others' lives in public space. We share results from a study with 19 participants. Participants expressed feeling connected to a shared life energy including others and the environment, and described heart sounds as feeling intimate yet anonymous. Finally, we elaborate the concept of life-affirmation in terms of recognition of others' lives, feeling connection, and respecting untranslatable differences with opacity, as a way of helping "smart city" designs embrace a multiplicity of desires.},

Rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. So, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: Ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore Ripple over 2 days of daily life. While some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' Ripple provided between body and emotion, for others Ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. Despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. Using biopolitics to speculate on Ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.},

As design futuring becomes established in HCI design research, there is an opportunity to expand and develop these approaches.

These modes concern formgiving, temporality, researcher positionality, real-world engagement, and knowledge production. We illustrate the value of each mode through careful analysis of selected design exemplars and provide questions to interrogate the practice of design futuring. Each reflective mode offers productive resources for design practitioners and researchers to articulate their work, generate new directions for their work, and analyze their own and others' work.},

The experience tells the stories of queer activists who influenced and produced Atlanta's patchwork of LGBTQ\,+\,organizations from the mid 1970s to the present. As a case study, this project offers insights on how wearability, embodiment, and queer archival methods can shape the design and experience of tangible historical narratives and their ability to call for reflection on our relationships to archival materials and history. This paper argues that queer methods can develop and reveal embodied, liminal stories in TNs in the following ways: 1. Using queer methods and queer archival scholarship to understand and design tangible narratives engenders experiences that resist binary narrative categories. 2. Designing queer history tangible narratives requires understanding the sociocultural context and the ways the experience itself can be queered. 3. Embodiment through wearability in a queer TN experience troubles the relation of bodies, spaces, selves, and stories---reinforcing our queer theoretical framing. Overall, this design case study illustrates how tangible storytelling design can be deepened through attention to queer methods, especially when used alongside embodiment and wearability.},

This paper presents five biodata-based case studies demonstrating how design researchers can create knowledge about human bodies and behaviors via strategies that allow them to engage data diffractively. These studies suggest that designers can find insights for designing with data as it is lived by working with it in a slow, open-ended fashion that leaves room for messiness and time for discovering difference. Finally, we discuss the role of ambiguous, open-ended data interpretations to help surface different meanings and entanglements of data in everyday lives.},

CDF allows us to consider, imagine, explore, and speculate on futures that are probable, possible, and even provocative and empowering. In this two-day workshop, we employ CDF to explore and imagine the future of human relationships - friendships, love, and romance - amidst a pandemic that has socially ravaged the entire world. Our changing relationship with each other and with technology is a hotbed of innovation, and an opportunity for us to reconsider and redefine human bonding and intimacy. The first day consists of expert presentations and discussions, where participants are introduced to CDF, designing for the future, and novel perspectives for thinking about the future. Participants work in small teams of 4-6, with one workshop organizer moderating each team, and collaboratively consider future, or past/present, scenarios, services, or products that assists in creating and/or nurturing human (or non-human) relationships. Participants have 24 hours to create a print, audio, or video advert for their product or service. On the second day, teams continue to work together to finalize their advert, which they then present and discuss in the larger group. Overall, the workshop aims to ignite innovative, and even provocative, ideas and alternative scenarios, building on this year's conference theme of ``Sense, Feel, Design''.}

  abstract = {Biosensing technologies are a rapidly increasing presence in our daily lives. These sensor-based technologies measure physiological processes including heart rate, breathing, skin conductance, brain activity and more. Researchers are exploring biosensing from perspectives including: engineering, human-computer interaction, medicine, mental health, consumer products, and interactive art. These technologies can enhance our interactions allowing connection to our bodies and others around us across diverse application areas. However, designing with biosignals in Human-Computer Interaction presents new challenges pertaining to User Experience, Input/Output, interpretation of signals, representation, and ethics. There is an urgent need to build a scholarly community that includes the diverse perspectives of researchers, designers, industry practitioners and policymakers. The goal of this workshop is to leverage the knowledge of this community aiming to map out the research landscape of emerging challenges and opportunities, and to build a research agenda for future directions.},

  abstract = {This one-day workshop will bring together researchers working with biodata and design for discussing and reflecting upon how design and HCI operate with the body and its data. The main workshop objective will be to identify core challenges and opportunities in this domain. We intend to cohere the projects of the workshop participants into a set of artifacts, images, and theory to create an annotated portfolio that represents the state-of-the art in designing with biodata in HCI. The workshop will be structured around four themes relating to the use and contexts of working with biodata: 1. Making sense of biodata by taking into account a holistic perspective of body, mind and emotions, as exemplified through soma design methods in HCI, for example; 2. Feminist perspectives of biodata that take into account bodily transitions, pluralities of bodies and temporalities of bodies; 3. Non-anthropocentric perspectives of working with and making sense of biodata, to also account for microorganisms and other material agencies in our bodies; and 4. Emerging domains, contexts, and practices around the use of biodata, such as health, affective, and performance contexts. The significance of the workshop is twofold: One, we will produce a group of researchers and practitioners that are working with biodata, aiming to unpack, discuss and respond to critical issues around designing with and for it. Two, we will create an annotated portfolio that can travel on its own as documentation and vision for future biodata-based design practices.},

  abstract = {A growing number of design researchers explore engagement with and through biodata. To help make sense of this growing space, we synthesize three emergent themes: (1) expanding notions of biodata and bodies, (2) attending to a greater diversity of human bodies and experiences with biodata, and (3) biodata collaborations between human and non-human bodies. We illustrate these themes with selected design examples. From this synthesis, we develop three interconnected fabulations reimagining alternative engagements with biodata: Weaving Alongside, Diffracting Selves, and Collective Affect. Our discussion unpacks conceptual work of the fabulations, offering invitations for design research to explore alternative ways of living and knowing together with biodata.},
