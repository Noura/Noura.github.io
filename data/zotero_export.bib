  abstract = {The problem of assigning frequencies to transmitters in a radio network can be modeled through vertex labelings of a graph, wherein each vertex represents a transmitter and edges connect vertices whose corresponding transmitters are operating in close proximity. In one such model, an L ( 2 , 1 ) -labeling of a graph G is employed, which is an assignment fof nonnegative integers to the vertices of G such that if vertices x and y are adjacent, | f ( x ) - f ( y ) | {$\geq$} 2 , and if x and y are at distance two, | f ( x ) - f ( y ) | {$\geq$} 1 . The {$\lambda$} -number of G is the minimum span over all L ( 2 , 1 ) -labelings of G. Informally, an amalgamation of two graphs G 1 and G 2 along a fixed graph G 0 is the simple graph obtained by identifying the vertices of two induced subgraphs isomorphic to G 0 , one of G 1 and the other of G 2 . We provide upper bounds for the {$\lambda$} -number of the amalgamation of graphs along a given graph by determining the exact {$\lambda$} -number of amalgamations of complete graphs along a complete graph. We also provide the exact {$\lambda$} -numbers of amalgamations of rectangular grids along a path, or more specifically, of the Cartesian products of a path and a star with spokes of arbitrary lengths.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the role dynamic textile displays play in relation to personal style: What does it mean to wear computationally responsive clothing and why would one be motivated to do so? We developed a novel textile display technology, called Ebb, and created several woven and crochet fabric swatches that explored clothing-specific design possibilities. We engaged fashion designers and non-designers in imagining how Ebb would integrate into their design practice or personal style of dressing. Participants evaluated the appeal and utility of clothing-based displays according to a very different set of criteria than traditional screen-based computational displays. Specifically, the slowness, low-resolution, and volatility of Ebb tended to be seen as assets as opposed to technical limitations in the context of personal style. Additionally, participants envisioned various ways that ambiguous, ambient, and abstract displays of information could prompt new experiences in their everyday lives. Our paper details the complex relationships between display and personal style and offers a new design metaphor and extension of Gaver et al.'s original descriptions of ambiguity in order to guide the design of clothing-based displays for everyday life.},

How do friends make sense of their own and each other's skin conductance display in the context of a conversation? We developed Hint, a dynamic thermochromic t-shirt whose ambiguous pattern changes color when its wearer's skin conductance increases, an indication of sudden arousal. We investigated how pairs of friends each wearing the shirt conversed and interpreted the display. Participants shared a broad range of interpretations; e.g., joy and embarrassment were associated with an increase in skin conductance. Additionally, participants expressed desires for their skin conductance display to help validate their feelings and show emotional engagement with others. We explore ambiguity in the context of clothing-based information displays and discuss how skin conductance display became part of social performance in our study. From there, we suggest framing biosignals as social cues along with facial expression, gestures, etc., and begin to question what design territories this might uncover.},

Yet this model has limitations, such as representing diverse human experiences as a singular point of ``the present'' and implicitly embedding notions of linear progress. Responding to this, we argue that a plurality of perspectives is needed to engage imaginations that depict a diverse unfolding of potential futures. Through reflecting on our own cultural and professional backgrounds, we offer five perspectives for design futuring as a contribution to this plurality: Parallel Presents, ``I Am Time'', Epithelial Metaphors, the Uncertainties Cone, and Meet (with) ``Speculation''. These perspectives open alternative approaches to design futuring, move outside prevalent notions of technological progress, and foreground interdependent, relational agencies.},

Our findings reflect on failures we identified in six past design research projects: issues of relational labor of deployment, mismatched designer/participant imaginaries, burden of participation, and invisibility of researcher labor. Our discussion contributes to broader reflections on shifting design research practice: (a) methodological considerations inviting others to engage failures through retrospective trioethnography, (b) letting go as a mode of research care, (c) possibilities for more candid research reporting, and (d) how centering failure may contribute to design justice by providing a technique for attending to harm and healing in design research practices. Throughout, we call for challenging success narratives in design research, and underscore the need for systemic changes in design research practice.},

Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience.},

While some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' Ripple provided between body and emotion, for others Ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had.

We explore engaging diffractively with `lived data' to surface felt and prospective aspects of data as it is entangled in everyday lives of designers. This paper presents five biodata-based case studies demonstrating how design researchers can create knowledge about human bodies and behaviors via strategies that allow them to engage data diffractively. These studies suggest that designers can find insights for designing with data as it is lived by working with it in a slow, open-ended fashion that leaves room for messiness and time for discovering difference. Finally, we discuss the role of ambiguous, open-ended data interpretations to help surface different meanings and entanglements of data in everyday lives.},

  abstract = {This one-day workshop will bring together researchers working with biodata and design for discussing and reflecting upon how design and HCI operate with the body and its data. The main workshop objective will be to identify core challenges and opportunities in this domain. We intend to cohere the projects of the workshop participants into a set of artifacts, images, and theory to create an annotated portfolio that represents the state-of-the art in designing with biodata in HCI. The workshop will be structured around four themes relating to the use and contexts of working with biodata: 1. Making sense of biodata by taking into account a holistic perspective of body, mind and emotions, as exemplified through soma design methods in HCI, for example; 2. Feminist perspectives of biodata that take into account bodily transitions, pluralities of bodies and temporalities of bodies; 3. Non-anthropocentric perspectives of working with and making sense of biodata, to also account for microorganisms and other material agencies in our bodies; and 4. Emerging domains, contexts, and practices around the use of biodata, such as health, affective, and performance contexts. The significance of the workshop is twofold: One, we will produce a group of researchers and practitioners that are working with biodata, aiming to unpack, discuss and respond to critical issues around designing with and for it. Two, we will create an annotated portfolio that can travel on its own as documentation and vision for future biodata-based design practices.},

  abstract = {A growing number of design researchers explore engagement with and through biodata. To help make sense of this growing space, we synthesize three emergent themes: (1) expanding notions of biodata and bodies, (2) attending to a greater diversity of human bodies and experiences with biodata, and (3) biodata collaborations between human and non-human bodies. We illustrate these themes with selected design examples. From this synthesis, we develop three interconnected fabulations reimagining alternative engagements with biodata: Weaving Alongside, Diffracting Selves, and Collective Affect. Our discussion unpacks conceptual work of the fabulations, offering invitations for design research to explore alternative ways of living and knowing together with biodata.},
